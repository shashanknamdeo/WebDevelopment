XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language) is a family of technologies used to style, transform, and display XML documents.

XSL includes three parts:
XSLT    - Transform XML
XPath   - Select parts of XML
XSL-FO  - Formatting for printing/PDF

XSLT is the most important. 


XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations)
is used to transform XML data into another format, such as:

HTML
Another XML document
Plain text
PDF (via XSL-FO)

It works by applying templates to XML nodes.


Purpose of XSLT

To convert XML into user-friendly formats
To rearrange, filter, or compute values from XML
To change structure of XML documents
To generate dynamic HTML pages from XML data
