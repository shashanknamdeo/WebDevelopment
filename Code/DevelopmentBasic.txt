Web Server

A web server handles HTTP/HTTPS requests from users.

Main responsibilities
    Accept requests from browser / mobile app
    Serve static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
    Forward dynamic requests to an application server
    SSL, compression, caching

Examples
    Nginx
    Apache

Application Server

An application server runs your backend code.

Main responsibilities
    Executes Python / Java / Node code
    Manages multiple worker processes
    Handles concurrency
    Talks to backend framework

Examples
    Python  ->  Gunicorn, uWSGI
    Java    ->  Tomcat
    Node.js ->  Built-in server

Frontend vs Backend
-------------------

Frontend (What the user sees)
--------------------------------
    Frontend = User Interface (UI)
    This is everything the user directly interacts with.

Examples:
    Website pages (buttons, text, forms)
    Mobile app screens
    Colors, layout, animations
    What happens when a user clicks or types

Technologies:
    Web: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    Frameworks/Libraries: React, Angular, Vue
    Mobile: React Native, Flutter

Key point:
    Frontend runs on the user’s device (browser or mobile app).


Backend (What the user does NOT see)
---------------------------------------
    Backend = Business logic + data handling
    This is everything that works behind the scenes.

Includes:
    User authentication (login, signup)
    APIs
    Business rules (who can do what)
    Processing data
    Saving and fetching data

    Technologies:
    Languages: Python, Java, Node.js, Go
    Frameworks: Django, Spring Boot, Express
    APIs: REST, GraphQL

Key point:
    Backend usually runs on a server, not on the user’s device.


Note:
    | Action                           | Frontend  |  Backend  |
    | -------------------------------- | --------  |  -------  |
    | Code for Button hover color      | ✅        | ❌       |
    | Code for Button click animation  | ✅        | ❌       |
    | Code for Form validation (basic) | ✅        | ❌       |
    | Login authentication             | ❌        | ✅       |
    | Saving data                      | ❌        | ✅       |
    | AI processing                    | ❌        | ✅       |

Backend Framework
    Backend framework = Software which manage Backend
    A backend framework helps you write backend logic easily.

Main responsibilities
    URL routing
    Authentication & authorization
    ORM (database access)
    API creation
    Validation
    Security helpers

Examples
    Django / Django REST Framework
    Flask
    Spring Boot
    Express.js

API (Application Programming Interface)
    -
    REST API (Representational State Transfer)
        Uses HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
        Data format: JSON (mostly)
        Stateless and lightweight
    -
    WebSocket API
        Full-duplex communication (real-time)
        Server and client both can send data
    -
    GraphQL API
        Developed by Facebook
        Client requests exact data it needs
        Single endpoint
    -
    gRPC API
        Developed by Google
        Uses Protocol Buffers
        Very fast and efficient
    -
    SOAP API (Simple Object Access Protocol)
    -
    RPC API (Remote Procedure Call)
    -
    Public vs Private vs Partner APIs
