Create an app
-------------

python manage.py startapp users apps/users

Command meaning
    python manage.py
        Think of it as  :   “Django, do this task for my project”
    startapp
        A Django command
        Means: create a new Django application (module)
    users
        This is the name of the app
        Django uses this name:
            In imports
            In settings
            In database migrations
        Example:
            from apps.users.models import UserProfile
    apps/users
        This is the directory where the app will be created

In apps/users/apps.py
    Change  name = 'users'
    To      name = 'apps.users'

Instead of cluttering root, we keep all apps inside /apps
