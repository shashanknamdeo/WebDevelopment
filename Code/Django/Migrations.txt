Django Migrations
-----------------
    python manage.py migrate
    Think of Django migrations as a bridge between your Python code (models) and the database.
    -
    When you define a model in Django (like User or StudyPlan), it’s just a Python class.
    The database doesn’t know about it yet.
    A migration is like a set of instructions that tells the database:
    “Create a table for this model, with these columns, types, constraints, relationships…”
    So migrations are automatically generated scripts that update your database schema.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


python manage.py makemigrations
-------------------------------

Creates instructions for the database based on your models.

Think of it like: “Django, look at my models.py files and write a plan for how the database should change.”

More clearly:
    Django checks all apps in INSTALLED_APPS
    Looks at models.py
    Compares:
        Current models
        Previous database state
    Then creates migration files (Python files)
        Example:  apps/users/migrations/0001_initial.py


Note:
    No database is changed yet
    Only migration files are created

When you use it
    After creating or changing models
    Before running migrate

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


python manage.py migrate
------------------------

Applies instructions made by {python manage.py makemigrations} to the database

Think of it like:   “Now actually create / update the database tables.”

More clearly:
    Reads migration files
    Executes SQL on PostgreSQL
    Creates tables, columns, relations
    Example:    CREATE TABLE users_userprofile (...);

Note :  This affects the real database.

When you use it
    After python manage.py makemigrations
    When setting up a new environment
    When updating schema
